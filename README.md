### Intro
This project uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyse the aforementioned statistical data, making it available to the general public through a webpage. By locating the HealthCare Facilities in the PMC region, we get an idea of how well spaced health care facilities are distributed. Factoring in population density, complexity of roads and the presence of Accident Hotspots in the area, the areas in dire need of Emergency Healthcare facilities can be illustrated.
