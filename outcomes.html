			<br><u><b>RESULT AND DISCUSSION</b></u>
			<p>Pune is in dire need of Healthcare facilities. The result of the Site Suitability Analysis, as seen above, gives us 4 areas, within a 1500m range of two Accident Prone areas- Chandni Chowk Kothrud and Dukkar Khind.
Keep in mind, the above analysis is merely a case study. Similar analyses may be conducted throughout the PMC region and on a more advanced level, across the country. Unfortunately, despite the boom in economy, healthcare still majorly behind, in India, especially in the less developed pockets.<br><br>
In the form of Healthcare Facilities, the option is open to build a Hospital with an Emergency Care Unit. However, in case of smaller areas (>50,000sq.m), the option of setting up ambulance services is still available.
While theoretically, these areas are optimal for erecting healthcare centres, the truth of the matter is while policy makers claim Health is a priority to them, budget allocations for said cause is yet to be reflected, bringing with it, all sorts of hurdles in utilizing this data for the good of the society.<br><br>
In the meantime, some reforms that may be worked towards, so as to bring about change to the pitiful healthcare situation are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Starting First Referral Units (FRUs) with surgical aid as well as ICU facilities.</li>
				<li>Stationing Mobile surgical services allows for the freedom to access areas, depending on the need of the hour. It also saves the infrastructural burden, making it a much more feasible alternative, short term.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, a collection of private specialists willing to spare some hours a week to aid the FRUs would help many lives.</li>
				<li>Provision of healthcare for the lesser developed pockets should be made affordable, keeping in mind the economic conditions pitted against their right to basic health care and emergency services in case of an accident.</li>
			</ul>
While these are solutions that the existing financial and human resource systems can endure, initiatives from higher powers are a necessity in this hour of need, to take what works on paper and turn it into a reality.
